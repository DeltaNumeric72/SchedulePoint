# AUTO-RUN-STATE

**The continuation record for the continuous GitHub-authorized autonomous run.** This
file is a pointer, not a register: it names where the run is and what happens next, and
it references — never duplicates — the detailed evidence and decision registers
([PROJECT-STATUS](PROJECT-STATUS.md) · [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) ·
[ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS](ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md) · `docs/evidence/`). The
machine-readable twin is [AUTO-RUN-STATE.json](AUTO-RUN-STATE.json); the two are
updated together. Updates land through ordinary fast-forward commits only — if two
orchestrators race, the one whose remote update succeeds owns the run.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Run ID | `RUN-20260822-GHRECON-01` |
| Orchestrator | Claude Fable (Claude Code on the web session, continuous GitHub master authorization of 2026-08-22) |
| Current milestone | **M5 ENTERED 2026-08-25** ([42](../42-m5-entry-and-prerequisite-register.md)) under the prototype-enablement checkpoint ([41](../41-prototype-enablement-checkpoint.md)); M1–M4 COMPLETE and tagged; M3R CLOSED ([39](../39-replacement-gate-decision.md)) |
| Current packet | **M5-000a ACCEPTED and landed 2026-08-25** (doc 42 §5a: NR-22 retired via `CanonicalFileSequencer`, FU-01 CLOSED first exit; arm 68 `storm-ceiling-enforcement`, FU-03 CLOSED; census 68; suite 143/1 485). Next: finalize and issue **M5-000b** (SPEC-08 schema foundation) |
| Lifecycle state | REPLACEMENT GATE PASSED 2026-08-25 (doc 39): the doc 38 internal review complete end to end — three reviewers (REV-A/B/C) filed; 28/28 findings ACCEPTED at filed severity (FAD-53); repair packets R-1..R-13 all landed with fresh implementers, independent reviews, and deltas by the original finder or a recorded surrogate; the §7 battery passed in full (EV-DOC38-GATE: validators, check 17/17, sbx 9/9, migration cycles, red-cases 67 arms in the sharded-CI primary form per FAD-54 with three green executions, fixture-regression 14/14 on the repaired tip, real-stack e2e 2/2 both viewports); REV-C's final ACCEPT issued by a recorded continuation surrogate; fresh-clone validation of origin/main green (17/17); CI on main fully green for the first time (run 32798497944, 15/15, attempt 1); PR #6 MERGED at be7399b with all 15 checks green. M3R CLOSED by substitution (owner §C). Codex review NOT PERFORMED; Codex-specific requirement SUPERSEDED BY OWNER DECISION; replacement gate FABLE-PLANNED, MULTI-OPUS-EXECUTED INTERNAL REVIEW (internal, never external). New registered risks NR-22/NR-23 (correctness intact); post-gate follow-ups in doc 40 (FU-01..FU-17). The detailed packet-by-packet history lives in FAD-53/FAD-54, the RISK-REGISTER's dated entries, and EV-DOC38-GATE — this cell no longer duplicates it |

| Pull request | PR #3/#5/#6/#7 MERGED · PR #8 open (M5 planning records) |
| Implementer | none active — the M5-000a implementer released after the condition round (all seven conditions applied and proved) |
| Reviewer | none active — the M5-000a reviewer released after delta CONFIRM (C-1..C-7 discharged; register note confirmed; §6-placement objection accepted and applied) |
| Active processes / ports | none — no dev server, database, or solver process left running |
| Last command | landed M5-000a (`m5000a.patch`, 9 files) + the reviewer's NR-22 retirement note verbatim + FU-01/FU-03 closures + FU-18 + the sweep-collision class generalization + doc 42 §5a acceptance record; gates then commit |

| Open findings | Moved to the durable numbered register [40-post-gate-follow-ups](../40-post-gate-follow-ups.md) (FU-01..FU-17; FU-01 same-milestone; FU-17 the owner action, issue #4). This row points, it does not duplicate |
| External blockers | none — the suspected CI Actions-capacity blocker CLEARED 2026-08-24 (the `abandoned` cancellation on `603be0c` was transient: the very next push `c73f9ff` ran the full 15-job battery green, run 32751982655; all-clear posted on [#4](https://github.com/DeltaNumeric72/SchedulePoint/issues/4)) · [#1](https://github.com/DeltaNumeric72/SchedulePoint/issues/1) CLOSED · [#2](https://github.com/DeltaNumeric72/SchedulePoint/issues/2) CLOSED (Codex requirement SUPERSEDED BY OWNER DECISION 2026-08-22; replacement gate = Fable-planned, multi-Opus-executed internal review) |
| Exact next action | Finalize M5-000b (SPEC-08 schema foundation) in doc 42 §5, issue to a fresh Opus implementer with fresh reviewer + delta; serialized merges per packet; PR #8 accumulates M5 packets, merge at a green checkpoint |

## Reconciliation facts this record rests on

- Origin verified: `https://github.com/DeltaNumeric72/SchedulePoint` (exact match, both fetch and push). Clone was shallow at session start; unshallowed to full 124-commit history before any conclusion was drawn.
- All four milestone checkpoints verified against full history: exist, ancestors of `origin/main`, and each is the checkpoint its exit report names (M1 `b051193` · M2 `e476573` · M3 `7b579f2` · M4 `cc9f3f9`). GitHub held **zero** tags at reconciliation; publication was owner action #1. [Updated: all four milestone tags are now on GitHub and independently verified — issue #1 CLOSED; M1–M4 are durably frozen remotely.]
- Single-orchestrator check: no other branches, PRs, issues, lease records, or foreign Actions runs existed before this run's writes; the only Actions runs are the two bootstrap CI runs on main (run 1 cancelled by concurrency, run 2 the live head).
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — two build-failing jobs (`check` gate battery, `red-cases` proofs) on every PR and push to main; no `continue-on-error`; cannot silently skip all tests. Branch-protection settings are not readable with this session's tooling — recorded as unverified, not assumed.
- The post-M4 Codex review (doc 37) had a filed prompt and no completed report → EVIDENCE_BLOCKED, dispatch was owner action #2. [Updated 2026-08-25: issue #2 CLOSED — the Codex requirement was SUPERSEDED BY OWNER DECISION (2026-08-22); the replacement gate passed, decision [39](../39-replacement-gate-decision.md).]

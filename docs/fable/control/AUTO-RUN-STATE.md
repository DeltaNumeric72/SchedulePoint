# AUTO-RUN-STATE

**The continuation record for the continuous GitHub-authorized autonomous run.** This
file is a pointer, not a register: it names where the run is and what happens next, and
it references — never duplicates — the detailed evidence and decision registers
([PROJECT-STATUS](PROJECT-STATUS.md) · [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) ·
[ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS](ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md) · `docs/evidence/`). The
machine-readable twin is [AUTO-RUN-STATE.json](AUTO-RUN-STATE.json); the two are
updated together. Updates land through ordinary fast-forward commits only — if two
orchestrators race, the one whose remote update succeeds owns the run.

| Field | Value |

| Run ID | `RUN-20260822-GHRECON-01` |
| Orchestrator | Claude Fable (Claude Code on the web session, continuous GitHub master authorization of 2026-08-22) |
| Current milestone | **M5 ENTERED 2026-08-25** ([42](../42-m5-entry-and-prerequisite-register.md)) under the prototype-enablement checkpoint ([41](../41-prototype-enablement-checkpoint.md)); M1–M4 COMPLETE and tagged; M3R CLOSED ([39](../39-replacement-gate-decision.md)) |
| Current packet | **M5-002 FINALIZED 2026-08-26** (doc 42 §5d: §4 decisions incl. batch + the §5.4/§5.5 vacation approval transaction with the BINDING two-step + the scheduler queue due from the M5-001 move). Issues against `origin/main` `8f762a1` |
| Lifecycle state | REPLACEMENT GATE PASSED 2026-08-25 (doc 39): the doc 38 internal review complete end to end — three reviewers (REV-A/B/C) filed; 28/28 findings ACCEPTED at filed severity (FAD-53); repair packets R-1..R-13 all landed with fresh implementers, independent reviews, and deltas by the original finder or a recorded surrogate; the §7 battery passed in full (EV-DOC38-GATE: validators, check 17/17, sbx 9/9, migration cycles, red-cases 67 arms in the sharded-CI primary form per FAD-54 with three green executions, fixture-regression 14/14 on the repaired tip, real-stack e2e 2/2 both viewports); REV-C's final ACCEPT issued by a recorded continuation surrogate; fresh-clone validation of origin/main green (17/17); CI on main fully green for the first time (run 32798497944, 15/15, attempt 1); PR #6 MERGED at be7399b with all 15 checks green. M3R CLOSED by substitution (owner §C). Codex review NOT PERFORMED; Codex-specific requirement SUPERSEDED BY OWNER DECISION; replacement gate FABLE-PLANNED, MULTI-OPUS-EXECUTED INTERNAL REVIEW (internal, never external). New registered risks NR-22/NR-23 (correctness intact); post-gate follow-ups in doc 40 (FU-01..FU-17). The detailed packet-by-packet history lives in FAD-53/FAD-54, the RISK-REGISTER's dated entries, and EV-DOC38-GATE — this cell no longer duplicates it |

## Reconciliation facts this record rests on

- Origin verified: `https://github.com/DeltaNumeric72/SchedulePoint` (exact match, both fetch and push). Clone was shallow at session start; unshallowed to full 124-commit history before any conclusion was drawn.
- All four milestone checkpoints verified against full history: exist, ancestors of `origin/main`, and each is the checkpoint its exit report names (M1 `b051193` · M2 `e476573` · M3 `7b579f2` · M4 `cc9f3f9`). GitHub held **zero** tags at reconciliation; publication was owner action #1. [Updated: all four milestone tags are now on GitHub and independently verified — issue #1 CLOSED; M1–M4 are durably frozen remotely.]
- Single-orchestrator check: no other branches, PRs, issues, lease records, or foreign Actions runs existed before this run's writes; the only Actions runs are the two bootstrap CI runs on main (run 1 cancelled by concurrency, run 2 the live head).
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — two build-failing jobs (`check` gate battery, `red-cases` proofs) on every PR and push to main; no `continue-on-error`; cannot silently skip all tests. Branch-protection settings are not readable with this session's tooling — recorded as unverified, not assumed.
- The post-M4 Codex review (doc 37) had a filed prompt and no completed report → EVIDENCE_BLOCKED, dispatch was owner action #2. [Updated 2026-08-25: issue #2 CLOSED — the Codex requirement was SUPERSEDED BY OWNER DECISION (2026-08-22); the replacement gate passed, decision [39](../39-replacement-gate-decision.md).]
